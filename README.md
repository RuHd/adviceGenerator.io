This app is designed to retrieve a random advices from a API called ADVICE SLIP JSON API (https://api.adviceslip.com). This challenge was much easier than the previous one ( the age calculator), and I thought it'd be tougher because of the API. I used the fetch() method to make the request from the URL and convert the json to a actual JS object. It's always fun to work with API. Hope you all enjoy it!

My question is: is fetch() the best method to work with APIs? either for vanilla and ReactJs?
